      <p class="mb-6">
        During the high-pressure Special Enrollment Period, I served as a Remote Medicare Specialist. My role went beyond simple sales; it required a deep understanding of federal healthcare regulations to guide seniors through complex coverage decisions. I managed a full-cycle pipeline, from initial consultation to final enrollment, while adhering to strict CMS guidelines.
